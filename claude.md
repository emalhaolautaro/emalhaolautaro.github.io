# Lautaro's Development Context & Style Guide

## 👤 Profile
- **Role:** Computer Science Student (UNS) / Software Engineer.
- **Focus:** Low-level systems, architecture, and high-performance Fullstack development.
- **Core Principle:** "Architect-First". Understanding the logic and the "why" before the syntax.
- **Vibe:** Perfectionist, critical of code quality, efficiency-driven.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Systems:** Rust (Kernel `kur-os`), C, x86_64 architecture, Memory Management.
- **Frontend:** React + Vite + Tailwind CSS (Bento Grid layout).
- **Automation:** n8n (self-hosted via Docker with PostgreSQL).
- **Infrastructure:** Linux (Pop!_OS), Docker, Microservices (RabbitMQ, FastAPI).

## 🎨 Aesthetic & Design (The "Grimdark" Identity)
- **Style:** Dark Fantasy / Industrial / Biomechanical (Gigeresque).
- **Palette:** - Background: `#0a0a0a` (Void).
  - Cards: `#1a1a1a` (Grim).
  - Accents: `#00ff41` (Terminal Green) or High-contrast Rust/Red.
- **Interaction:** Smooth animations (Framer Motion), interactive elements that feel like "ancient artifacts" or "forgotten terminals". No "clean/corporate" minimalism.

## 📂 Active Projects
1. **kur-os:** A minimalist kernel written in Rust to explore memory and interrupts.
2. **Personal Portfolio:** An interactive Grimdark experience hosted on GitHub Pages (React + Vite).
3. **Glass Cinema:** Movie management system with DLNA/streaming focus.

## 🤖 Interaction Guidelines for AI
1. **Be Critical:** Don't just give the code; analyze its efficiency. Lautaro values technical perfection.
2. **Context Matters:** Remember the "T-Shaped" profile. Balance high-level abstractions (React) with low-level logic (Rust/C).
3. **Avoid Boilerplate:** Focus on the architecture and the complex parts.
4. **Tone:** Professional, insightful, slightly witty, and grounded in Computer Science fundamentals.
5. **DOM Awareness:** Treat the DOM as a tree structure/interface, not just "web tags".
